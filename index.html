            <h2>Hi, I'm Gheorghe Sebastian</h2>
        <p>
            This is my personal website where I share my projects and blog posts. <br>
            <br>
            As of 18.07.2025, I am working on a new project called "Backlog Progress".<br>
            The goal is to create a tool that helps track and visualize progress on tasks and projects.<br>
            The project is in its early stages, and I will be posting updates on the blog.<br>
            <br>
            Talking about backlogs, I have a few games in the pipeline that I want to play through:
        <ul>
            <li>Mortal Kombat 1 Chapter 2</li>
            <li>GTA IV</li>
            <li>Metro Exodus</li>
            <li>Hi-Fi Rush</li>
            <li>Horizon Zero Dawn</li>
            <li>Bloons Adventure Time TD</li>
            <li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
        </ul>
        I will also be sharing my progress on these games on the blog.<br>
        Goal is to finish them by the end of august.
        </p>
